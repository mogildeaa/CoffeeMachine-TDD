#### Project intended to showcase the "test driven development" software development method.
* Based on the requirements of the software, I implemented the **functionality** (in this case I come up with some test scenarios which can be seen in *CofeeMachineShould.java* class)
* The functionality is implemented until all **test cases** created are passed

### Key elements:
* use of a **Enum** and a default (private) constructor within it
* private fields to showcase OOP concepts (**encapsulation**)
* use of a **Interface** (showcase **inheritance** and **overriding**)
* use of **S.O.L.I.D** class design principles
